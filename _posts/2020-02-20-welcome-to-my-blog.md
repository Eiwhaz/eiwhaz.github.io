Welcome to this blog I've finally started! I'll mostly post articles about RaZ & C++, but there will most likely be various subjects I may consider writing about, according to what I'm currently interested in.

This also serves as a website for [RaZ](/RaZ/ "RaZ"), to host its [documentation](/RaZ/doc/ "RaZ - Documentation") and show its evolution.

In any case, stay tuned for more content to come!
