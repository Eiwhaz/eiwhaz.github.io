My name is {{ site.author.name }}. I am a french C++ graphics developer, constantly learning many things & always eager to do so.

Computer graphics enthusiast, I'm mainly interested in rendering (both offline & real-time). I've also taken several years ago a liking to image processing and augmented reality, and have a growing interest for physics simulations.

I love finding (subjectively) elegant solutions to problems. Code-wise, I can be a bit of a maniac when it comes to consistency & performance. C++ is my main language, but Rust has been a close challenger some time ago, and may well be coming back to me someday.

Gaming lover, which my \~1000 games on Steam can attest, I find myself increasingly liking discovering games with fresh ideas.
